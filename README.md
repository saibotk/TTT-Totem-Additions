For now, it adds some Shinigami/DeathGrip GUI elements, such as:  
  
- Shinigami hint: Displays the Shinigami Role icon on the right side, if a round has a Shinigami / Deathgrip  
  ( Can be disabled with 'ttt_totem_additions_shinigui_hint 0' )  

- Shinigami Traitor info: Displays traitor's names in red boxes on the bottom of the screen. Useful to keep in mind who to kill as Shinigami.  
  ( Can be disabled with 'ttt_totem_additions_shinigui_info 0' )  

- Deathgrip Warning: Shows an indicator above the crosshair, that the person, you are aiming at is in Deathgrip with you or with a teammate
